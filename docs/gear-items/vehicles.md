# **Vehicles**

Vehicles are an extension of survival and power in Echo City — tools of mobility, warfare, and prestige. From black-market hoverbikes to Veil-infused war machines, they obey the same chaos as their pilots.

## **Vehicle Basics**

| Term | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Speed** | The maximum distance a vehicle can travel on its turn (measured in feet per round or miles per hour out of combat). |
| **Handling** | A modifier applied to Dexterity (Driving) checks to control or maneuver the vehicle. |
| **Armor Class (AC)** | Represents the vehicle’s structural resilience and agility. |
| **Hit Points (HP)** | Tracks the vehicle’s condition. When reduced to 0 HP, the vehicle becomes disabled. |
| **Crew / Capacity** | Indicates how many occupants a vehicle can hold, including pilot and passengers. |
| **Tier** | Indicates overall quality, power, and rarity of the vehicle — aligning with the gear economy tiers. |

## **Operating Vehicles**

### **Driving Checks**
Piloting, high-speed maneuvers, or avoiding hazards require a **Dexterity (Driving)** check.  
If the vehicle is heavily augmented or digital in nature, **Intelligence (Technology)** may apply instead.

| Situation | Suggested DC |
|------------|---------------|
| Normal operation | — |
| Difficult terrain, dense traffic | 12–15 |
| Pursuit or evasion | 15–18 |
| Combat maneuvers, drifting, or ramming | 18–22 |

## **Combat with Vehicles**

- **Initiative:** The pilot rolls initiative using their **Dexterity (Driving)** modifier.  
- **Actions:** Vehicles act on the pilot’s turn. Passengers can use their own actions normally.  
- **Ramming:** On a successful attack, deal **(Speed ÷ 10)d6** bludgeoning damage to both the target and vehicle.  
- **Mounted Weapons:** Some vehicles come with fixed or turreted weapons that use the pilot’s or gunner’s action.  
- **Critical Hits:** If a vehicle takes half of its HP in damage from one source, roll on the **Vehicle Malfunction Table**.

## **Vehicle Malfunction Table**

| d6 | Result |
|----|---------|
| 1 | **Engine Overheat:** Vehicle loses half movement until repaired. |
| 2 | **Control Lock:** Next Driving check is made with disadvantage. |
| 3 | **Armor Breach:** AC reduced by 2 until repaired. |
| 4 | **Sensor Disruption:** Attacks or Perception checks from the vehicle have disadvantage. |
| 5 | **System Flicker:** Vehicle functions erratically — 50% chance of skipping its next turn. |
| 6 | **Catastrophic Failure:** Vehicle becomes inoperable after 1d4 rounds unless stabilized. |

## **Repair & Maintenance**

- **Field Repair:** Requires a **Technology check (DC 15)** and 10 minutes per repair. Restores 2d10 HP.  
- **Full Overhaul:** Takes 1 hour and access to proper tools or a garage; restores all HP.  
- **Parts & Credits:** Repairing a vehicle typically costs **10% of its base price per tier**.

## **Design Philosophy**

Every vehicle reflects its owner — from the corporate enforcers of the Glass Covenant to the rusted street racers of the Undergrid.  
Whether a hovercycle slicing through neon rain or a Void-powered crawler braving the wastes, these machines are as much identity as they are transport.  
DM's and players can work together to create custom vehicles appropriate for their tier.
