# Cybernetics

Cybernetic augmentations grant unique enhancements, some requiring attunement or specialized installation.

---

## Installation Rules
- Installing a cybernetic implant requires **4–24 hours** of downtime and a **DC 12–18 Medicine or Technology check**, depending on tier.  
- A character can normally benefit from **up to 2 augmentations per tier** before risking **Corruption** or **System Instability**.  
- **Faction Cybernetics** may require a **Reputation Threshold** and **attunement**; failure to meet faction loyalty requirements may cause rejection or malfunction.
