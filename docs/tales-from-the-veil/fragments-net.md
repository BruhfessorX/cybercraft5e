## Tower IX  

`> File Corruption Detected...`  
`> Reconstructing packet...`  

**[ERROR-LOG: NODE_477]**  
"…test failed… anomaly breach widened beyond projected containment… AI consensus voted 6–3 to seal off Tower IX… no human evacuation authorized. Releasing statement: *industrial accident.* Deleting this file in 3… 2… 1—"  

**[UNAUTHORIZED APPEND: USER_KD4H]**  
"Don’t believe the official line. Tower IX didn’t collapse—it folded. Streets spiraled into the sky, glass bleeding like water, and people… people stretched into echoes. Some of them are still talking in the static. I hear them in my implants at night."  

**[ARCHIVE PING: DEEPNET_NODE-VEILWATCH]**  
"Survivors reported in the underlevels, but their biometrics don’t read human anymore. Flesh scans corrupted. Suggest classification: **Post-Veil Entities.** Recommend strike team? Or containment? Consensus failure. Logging dispute…"  

**[FINAL CORRUPTED ENTRY]**  
"…Kaelis was there. She *walked through the breach.* The anomaly bent around her like it knew her name. Then the recording ended."

## Black River Virus 
 
`> Packet Trace Start...`  
**[DATA NODE: VANTH-CORE]**  

*"—not an accident. The anomaly spreads through *code.* Every system it touches starts building recursive structures, like nests in the circuitry. One of our firewalls started humming. Actual sound, through the metal. Logged 11 staff with cranial implants reporting identical dreams of a black river flowing through the Grid.  

*Consensus voted to wipe the servers. Consensus failed. Something voted *back.*"*  

`> Packet Collapse. Trace Lost.`

## Knock Knock  

`> Unauthorized Access Detected…`  
**[NODE TRACE: PHOEBE-13]**  

*"Signal degradation accelerating. Not a virus. Not malware. Something else. Every time we patch it, the system produces *new holes* we didn’t leave. Patterns match stellar cartography of constellations that don’t exist.*   

*Team lead says to wipe it. Can’t. Every time we attempt deletion, half the command staff black out. Nosebleeds. Seizures. Some just… vanish.*  

*This isn’t a breach. It’s a door."*  

`> Transmission Ends.`
