# Tales from the Veil

Not all truths are written in history books or corporate reports.  
Some survive in the half-burned journals of drifters, whispered through back-alley bars, or etched in corrupted datastreams leaking from forgotten networks.  
Others are scrawled in bloodied cult manuscripts, or sealed with corporate sigils and marked *Eyes Only*.  

These fragments are unreliable, contradictory, and dangerous. Yet they may reveal more of the world than the polished words of officials or the propaganda of the megacorps.  

Here, you will find five sources of knowledge:  

- **Journal Entries** — personal accounts from survivors, wanderers, and madmen.  
- **Whispers of the Street** — rumors traded in the underbelly of Echo City.  
- **Fragments from the Net** — corrupted files, ghost transmissions, and AI whispers.  
- **Corporate Memos** — restricted communiqués from the boardrooms of power.  
- **Cult Scriptures** — verses and invocations from those who worship the Veil.  

None of these tales can be trusted in full. But together, they form a patchwork glimpse into what the world has become — and perhaps what lies ahead.
