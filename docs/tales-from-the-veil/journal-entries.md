They said the anomaly was sealed, that the district had been purged. Corporate sweepers rolled in with drones and fire and swore there was nothing left but ash. But tonight, when I cut through the old transit hub, I saw the air folding like broken glass.  

The floor wasn’t floor anymore. Stairs stretched sideways, flickering between steel and stone. Every light buzzed in colors I don’t think my eyes were meant to understand. And the sound—like a thousand whispers, each one using my name.  

I should have run, but I couldn’t. Something about the distortion held me there, like my body wasn’t my own. In the reflection of a shattered window, I saw myself—but taller, thinner, with eyes burned hollow. It smiled when I couldn’t.  

By the time I stumbled home, three hours had passed… but the clock on my retinal implant swears it was less than five minutes. I don’t know what came back with me. I only know the whispers followed.  

*End of Fragment. File Corrupted.*

The floodlights failed again in Sector 19, so I lit a flare to make it through the rubble. The shadows bent wrong. They leaned *toward* the light instead of away from it.  

I thought I was alone until I heard boots echoing behind me. Every time I turned, nothing. The sound got closer, faster, until it was my own footsteps out of sync. I ran. The flare sputtered and went out, but the steps kept running beside me.  

When I finally reached the checkpoint, the guards scanned me twice. They swore there was a *second Serrano* trailing right behind. But the cameras never caught it.

Woke up three blocks from my pod with no memory of leaving. The streets were quiet — too quiet, like the whole sector had been muted. Even the neon signs flickered without sound.  

There was writing across the walls, looping in a language I didn’t know, but every word *felt* like it was about me. I kept walking and the letters shifted — became warnings, became prayers, became my name again and again.  

By the time I reached the sector gates, the words peeled themselves off the walls. I can still feel them crawling under my skin. The scanners didn’t flag anything, but I know they’re still there, waiting.
