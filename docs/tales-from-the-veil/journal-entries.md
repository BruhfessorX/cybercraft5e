They said the anomaly was sealed, that the district had been purged. Corporate sweepers rolled in with drones and fire and swore there was nothing left but ash. But tonight, when I cut through the old transit hub, I saw the air folding like broken glass.  

The floor wasn’t floor anymore. Stairs stretched sideways, flickering between steel and stone. Every light buzzed in colors I don’t think my eyes were meant to understand. And the sound—like a thousand whispers, each one using my name.  

I should have run, but I couldn’t. Something about the distortion held me there, like my body wasn’t my own. In the reflection of a shattered window, I saw myself—but taller, thinner, with eyes burned hollow. It smiled when I couldn’t.  

By the time I stumbled home, three hours had passed… but the clock on my retinal implant swears it was less than five minutes. I don’t know what came back with me. I only know the whispers followed.
