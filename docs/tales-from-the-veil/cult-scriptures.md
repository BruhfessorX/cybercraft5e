## Black Spire Manuscript, Verse XII: "The Choir of Teeth"   

*"And lo, the Veil tore, and from it spilled the Choir of Teeth. Their song was agony, but their gift was clarity. Blessed are those who see the truth in broken glass, for through fracture comes eternity. We do not fear the rift. We *are* the rift."*  

*"The Choir devours the false, polishing bone until only light remains. To walk unshaken among the echoes, one must sing as they sing, bleed as they bleed. The glass is not a wound but a window, and through its shards the true shape of the world is revealed."*  

*"Mark your flesh with the hymn. Speak your name into the rift and be unmade. For only in unmaking shall you endure forever."*
