## Black Spire Manuscript, Verse XII: "The Choir of Teeth"   

*"And lo, the Veil tore, and from it spilled the Choir of Teeth. Their song was agony, but their gift was clarity. Blessed are those who see the truth in broken glass, for through fracture comes eternity. We do not fear the rift. We *are* the rift."*  

*"The Choir devours the false, polishing bone until only light remains. To walk unshaken among the echoes, one must sing as they sing, bleed as they bleed. The glass is not a wound but a window, and through its shards the true shape of the world is revealed."*  

*"Mark your flesh with the hymn. Speak your name into the rift and be unmade. For only in unmaking shall you endure forever."*

## Hymn of the Hollow Flame  

*"The fire within is not warmth, but hunger. Let it consume your marrow until you are nothing but vessel. Only then may the Veil pour through you unbroken.*  

*Do not pray to the gods of ash. They were the first to be devoured. Instead, pray to the emptiness in your chest, for it is the truest altar.*    

*Through hollowing we ascend, and through flame we remember what it means to never die."*
