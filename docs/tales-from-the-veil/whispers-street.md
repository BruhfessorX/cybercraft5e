## Lady Kaelis Vorn — Voice of the Vampyrus Nation  

"They say Lady Kaelis Vorn never walks anywhere. She floats, just a few inches above the ground, like the Veil itself is carrying her. Saw her once in the Fleshmarket, blood-red parasol glowing against the haze. Every ganger cleared out like rats. Who owns the streets? Not us. Not anymore."  

"Word is, her shadow doesn’t match her shape. Sometimes it lags behind, sometimes it bends toward you even when the light’s wrong. A crew of cutters tried to tail her once—three days later, all they found were empty skins hung on rusted hooks in an old underpass. No blood, no organs. Just husks."  

"Doesn’t matter if you’re Syndicate, Splicer, or just a kid hustling scraps. If Kaelis looks your way, you don’t breathe, you don’t move. The CorpSec don’t chase her, the Anomalies don’t touch her, and the Veil sings when she passes. The streets don’t belong to mortals anymore—they belong to her."
