## Lady Kaelis Vorn

"They say Lady Kaelis Vorn never walks anywhere. She floats, just a few inches above the ground, like the Veil itself is carrying her. Saw her once in the Fleshmarket, blood-red parasol glowing against the haze. Every ganger cleared out like rats. Who owns the streets? Not us. Not anymore."  

"Word is, her shadow doesn’t match her shape. Sometimes it lags behind, sometimes it bends toward you even when the light’s wrong. A crew of cutters tried to tail her once—three days later, all they found were empty skins hung on rusted hooks in an old underpass. No blood, no organs. Just husks."  

"Doesn’t matter if you’re Syndicate, Splicer, or just a kid hustling scraps. If Kaelis looks your way, you don’t breathe, you don’t move. The CorpSec don’t chase her, the Anomalies don’t touch her, and the Veil sings when she passes. The streets don’t belong to mortals anymore—they belong to her."

## Tower Twelve  

*"Heard about the blackout last week? Tower Twelve went dark for exactly thirteen minutes. Everyone inside swears they saw things moving in the glass walls, like people pressed up against the surface from the other side. When the power came back, half the execs in that boardroom were gone. No alarms. No exit logs. Just… gone. You tell me who’s running the lights now."*

## Silver Rail  
 
*"They say the trains in Old Echo don’t run on rails anymore. Haven’t for years. You stand on the platform at the wrong hour and one rolls in — silver, dripping wet, doors wide open. Folks swear it goes somewhere under the river, but nobody who boards has ever come back. Last I heard, one of the rail gangs posted a watch there. Haven’t seen them since either."*
