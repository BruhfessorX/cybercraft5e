## Memo 77-A: "Containment Protocol Revisions" 

**From:** Executive Council, Synapse Corp.  
**To:** Division Heads, Bio-Arcana Development  
**Timestamp:** 2230.07.19  

*"Effective immediately, all Veil-resonant test subjects are to be secured off-grid. Public exposure must be reduced to zero. Street activity suggests rumors of ‘living anomalies’ are spreading. Any leaks will be handled by Disposal Division. Remember: Synapse holds the patent on immortality."*  

**Addendum:**  
- Disposal Division is authorized to neutralize *any* personnel compromised by Veil resonance, regardless of clearance level.  
- Subject transfers are no longer to be conducted through public-sector facilities; use subterranean transit only.  
- Reports indicate factions within Echo City are attempting to acquire resonant subjects. Intelligence suggests infiltration attempts by **Vorn Syndicate operatives**.  

**Closing Directive:**  
*"Do not forget: survival in Echo City depends on controlling the narrative. We own the research. We own the patents. We own the future. Anyone who forgets that—becomes expendable."*

## Memo 12-C: Containment Directive “Obsidian Canal”  
  
**From:** Iron Crown Industries, Security Division  
**To:** All Regional Enforcers  
**Timestamp:** 2209.01.04  

*"Effective immediately, all unauthorized excavation projects in Veil Zones are to be terminated. Recent breaches in Lower Sector 3 have revealed structures predating the city itself. These ruins are not to be documented, cataloged, or discussed outside Iron Crown channels.*  

*Archaeological theft is theft from the Corporation. And theft from the Corporation is death.*  

*Failure to comply will trigger Clause 88: Asset Dissolution."*

## Memo 210: Directive Theta-9: "Human Factors"  
 
**From:** Veyla Dynamics, Department of Strategic Advancement  
**To:** All Division Supervisors  
**Timestamp:** 2174.10.21

*"Reports confirm unauthorized unions forming among augmentation workers. They whisper of Veil immunity, claiming their implants ‘sing’ when anomalies bloom.*  

*All personnel are reminded: patents extend to flesh as well as steel. The concept of *ownership* is not limited to devices. Should you hear talk of ‘bodies that belong to no one,’ notify Internal Oversight immediately.*  

*Remember: A worker is an asset. A free worker is a liability."*
