## Memo 77-A: "Containment Protocol Revisions" 

**From:** Executive Council, Synapse Corp.  
**To:** Division Heads, Bio-Arcana Development  
**Timestamp:** 2230.07.19  

*"Effective immediately, all Veil-resonant test subjects are to be secured off-grid. Public exposure must be reduced to zero. Street activity suggests rumors of ‘living anomalies’ are spreading. Any leaks will be handled by Disposal Division. Remember: Synapse holds the patent on immortality."*  

**Addendum:**  
- Disposal Division is authorized to neutralize *any* personnel compromised by Veil resonance, regardless of clearance level.  
- Subject transfers are no longer to be conducted through public-sector facilities; use subterranean transit only.  
- Reports indicate factions within Echo City are attempting to acquire resonant subjects. Intelligence suggests infiltration attempts by **Vorn Syndicate operatives**.  

**Closing Directive:**  
*"Do not forget: survival in Echo City depends on controlling the narrative. We own the research. We own the patents. We own the future. Anyone who forgets that—becomes expendable."*
