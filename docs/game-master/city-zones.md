## Notable Districts of Echo City

### 1. Neon Spire (Corporate Towers)
The crown jewel of corporate dominance, a forest of glass-and-chrome skyscrapers lit in endless advertisements.  
- **Vibe:** Clinical, opulent, tightly controlled.  
- **Security:** AI drones, biometric scanners, and invisible firewalls.  
- **Hooks:** Data heist in a CEO’s penthouse; infiltration during a high-profile gala; sabotage hidden in a corporate merger.  
- **Faction Presence:** OmniCore Conglomerate (major), Virex Security (major), Ghostlink Syndicate (minor infiltration).  
- **Danger Rating:** ★★☆☆☆ — High security, but relatively safe for those with clearance.  
- **Notable NPCs:**  
  - **Director Kael Draven** — OmniCore exec obsessed with containing Veil breaches.  
  - **Alina Voss** — Corporate fixer with dirt on multiple megacorps.  
- **GM Notes:** Ideal for espionage, social intrigue, and high-tech theft.

### 2. Rustline (Street Sectors)
A chaotic industrial stretch where the lights never fully work and the air tastes like iron.  
- **Vibe:** Working-class grit, gangs running “security,” and black-market stalls.  
- **Security:** Local enforcers on payroll; gang muscle.  
- **Hooks:** Escort a smuggler through gang turf; shut down an illegal cybernetics chop-shop; protect a witness before they vanish.

---

### 3. Chasm Edge (Veil Zone)
A cracked rift in the megacity’s foundation, where the Veil’s energy bleeds into the streets.  
- **Vibe:** Half-ruined, half-rebuilt; reality bends in strange ways.  
- **Security:** None reliable — only desperate cults and scavenger crews.  
- **Hooks:** Hunt down an escaped Veil creature; salvage tech twisted by eldritch power; rescue someone lost to a temporal fold.

---

### 4. The Haze Market
An underground bazaar sprawling beneath the city, lit by flickering neon strips and shrouded in smoke from a hundred cooking stalls.  
- **Vibe:** Loud, vibrant, dangerous; a place where you can buy *anything*.  
- **Security:** Market guards turn a blind eye if paid well enough.  
- **Hooks:** Recover a stolen prototype hidden in the market; broker a meeting between rival factions; escape after a deal goes bad.

---

### 5. Blackwater Heights
A residential block built into the side of an abandoned water-processing megafacility.  
- **Vibe:** Damp, claustrophobic, eerily quiet except for the hum of machinery.  
- **Security:** Minimal — locals rely on secrecy and familiarity.  
- **Hooks:** Investigate disappearances linked to the old filtration tunnels; stop a cult’s ritual in the flooded lower floors; hide from corporate hunters.
