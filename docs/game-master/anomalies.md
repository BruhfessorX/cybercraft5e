# Anomalies & The Veil  

Anomalies are fractures where the Veil leaks into reality. They are the scars of Lavara’s broken world — zones where physics falters, time frays, and entities beyond comprehension slip through. No two Anomalies are ever the same, and even the most seasoned explorers tread carefully when one appears.

## Types of Anomalies  

- **Spatial Distortions**  
  Streets that fold back on themselves, staircases that climb forever, or doors that open into places that should not exist. Inside, distances warp — a hallway may stretch for miles or collapse into a single step.  

- **Temporal Echoes**  
  The past bleeds into the present: soldiers frozen mid-march, citizens reliving their final moments, clocks spinning wildly. Some echoes drag intruders into loops that last hours — or years — before releasing them.  

- **Entity Manifestations**  
  When the Veil thins, beings emerge. Some are predatory hunters, others inscrutable observers, and a rare few offer bargains. Even the most benign entities carry risks of corruption simply by proximity.  

- **Reality Bleeds**   
  Color drains, sound distorts, and gravity falters. Travelers may feel watched or hear whispers in static. Extended time in such zones erodes not only the body but the soul.

## Severity Tiers  

Anomalies vary in scale, danger, and stability. Use these tiers to scale encounters and story impact:  

**Minor Anomalies**  
  - Usually small (1–2 city blocks).  
  - Primarily atmospheric or mildly hazardous.  
  - **Effect Examples:** Shadows detach, clocks stutter, gravity shifts slightly, mild Sanity checks (DC 10–12).  
  - Duration: 1d6 hours or until disrupted.  

**Major Anomalies**  
  - Spread across whole districts or industrial sectors.  
  - Cause serious environmental hazards and spawn entities.  
  - **Effect Examples:** Time loops trap victims, streets fold endlessly, corrupted creatures emerge, Sanity checks (DC 14–16).  
  - Duration: 1d6 days, often studied or quarantined by factions.  

**Cataclysmic Anomalies**  
  - Tear reality wide open, altering the city permanently.  
  - Impossible geometries consume skyscrapers, whole districts vanish into the Veil, or titanic entities walk openly.  
  - **Effect Examples:** Rift storms, multi-entity invasions, permanent corruption zones, Sanity checks (DC 18–20+).  
  - Duration: Indefinite — often only sealed by narrative intervention, powerful rituals, or corporate/GM fiat.

## Rules for Anomalies  

- **Detection:** A successful **Wisdom (Perception)** or **Intelligence (Arcana/Technology)** check may spot warning signs: flickering lights, distorted reflections, or sound lag.  
- **Proximity Effects:** Any creature within an Anomaly must make **Sanity saving throws** (DC varies by severity). Failure results in short-term conditions such as **Glitched**, **Confused**, or mild hallucinations.  
- **Extended Exposure:** After 1 hour inside an Anomaly, roll a **Corruption Check**. Mutations, psychic scarring, or permanent Veil-touched abilities may manifest.  
- **Stability:** Some Anomalies collapse in minutes, others last decades. Game Masters may roll 1d6 for lifespan in **hours (Minor)**, **days (Major)**, or **indefinite (Cataclysmic)**.

## Using Anomalies in Play  

- **Exploration Hooks:** Anomalies are natural quest hubs — scavengers chase rare resources, corporations want data, cultists worship them, and ordinary citizens fear them.  
- **Dynamic Terrain:** They change maps into living hazards. A firefight in a warped street becomes chaos when the walls start folding.  
- **Mystery Factor:** No two Anomalies should feel alike; describe them with dream-logic and sensory dissonance.
