# Setting Overview

**Cybercraft** takes place in **Echo City** — a sprawling, neon-drenched megacity built atop the bones of ancient ruins where the **Veil** between realities runs dangerously thin.

## Key Facts
- **Urban Divisions:** Echo City is split into towering **Corporate Towers**, chaotic **Street Sectors**, and unstable **Veil Zones** where reality frays.  
- **The Veil:** A metaphysical boundary through which eldritch energy seeps, warping minds, machines, and the city itself.  
- **Mega-Factions:** Vast corporate and syndicate powers control resources, dictate law, and shape the fate of entire districts.  

## Tone
Imagine **Bladerunner**'s neon rain, fused with **Lovecraftian** horror, and touched with the anarchic magic-tech chaos of **Shadowrun**.

## Life in Echo City

The city never sleeps — its pulse beats through holo-ads, humming mag-trains, and the constant chatter of the datasphere. Life here is a precarious balancing act between survival, ambition, and avoiding the Veil’s corruption.

### Daily Life
- **Corporate Elite:** Live in glass-and-chrome penthouses high above the smog. Their world is one of security drones, corporate feasts, and political intrigue.  
- **Street-Level Survivors:** Crowded apartments, street markets, and gang-controlled alleys define the lives of most residents. The weak are prey, the bold thrive.  
- **Veil-Zone Dwellers:** Outcasts, smugglers, and occultists call the unstable fringes home, trading sanity for opportunity in a place where reality is negotiable.

### Dangers
- **Veil Surges:** Sudden bursts of eldritch energy that warp matter, flesh, and code alike.  
- **Faction Wars:** Corporate black-ops, gang turf battles, and cult uprisings can turn districts into warzones overnight.  
- **Corruption:** Both political and supernatural — the longer you’re exposed to the Veil, the more it changes you.

### Opportunities
- **Cybernetic Enhancement:** Whether bought, stolen, or black-market installed, augments can give you an edge.  
- **Eldritch Power:** Those who dare can channel the Veil’s energies — for a price.  
- **The Shadows:** Information brokering, artifact smuggling, or sabotage jobs pay well if you can keep your head down and your trail cold.

**In Echo City,** you’re either climbing, running, or falling. The only question is: which way are you headed when the Veil reaches out?
