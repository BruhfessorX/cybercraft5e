# Setting Overview

21st Century Collapse: Climate failure and corporate monopolies caused resource wars, ecological devastation, and political collapse. Deep-drilling beneath modern-day Echo City uncovered ancient ruins inscribed with alien glyphs. This broke the Veil, a metaphysical barrier holding back eldritch forces.

Nuclear Retaliation (c. 2080s): In panic, remaining superpowers launched nuclear strikes, hoping to seal or destroy the breach. Instead, devastation spread, wiping out most of Earth’s population and destabilizing ecosystems permanently.

Rise of New Powers (2100–2200):

Corporations fortified themselves into Towers, adapting Veil-energy into cybernetics, weapons, and biotech.

Cultist Oligarchies emerged, worshiping and bargaining with entities beyond the Veil, consolidating influence over desperate survivors.

Street Sectors became self-organized enclaves of scavengers, gangs, and fractured communities.

Veil Zones formed where energy leaks warped reality, creating hazards, monsters, and opportunities for power.

Current Era (2231): Echo City sprawls across Lavara’s scarred landscape, built atop the original breach. It is divided into Corporate Towers, Street Sectors, and Veil Zones. The Veil continues to expand in subtle ways, promising both ruin and ascension to those who dare to exploit it.

## Life in Echo City

The city never sleeps — its pulse beats through holo-ads, humming mag-trains, and the constant chatter of the datasphere. Life here is a precarious balancing act between survival, ambition, and avoiding the Veil’s corruption.

### Daily Life
- **Corporate Elite:** Live in glass-and-chrome penthouses high above the smog. Their world is one of security drones, corporate feasts, and political intrigue.  
- **Street-Level Survivors:** Crowded apartments, street markets, and gang-controlled alleys define the lives of most residents. The weak are prey, the bold thrive.  
- **Veil-Zone Dwellers:** Outcasts, smugglers, and occultists call the unstable fringes home, trading sanity for opportunity in a place where reality is negotiable.

### Dangers
- **Veil Surges:** Sudden bursts of eldritch energy that warp matter, flesh, and code alike.  
- **Faction Wars:** Corporate black-ops, gang turf battles, and cult uprisings can turn districts into warzones overnight.  
- **Corruption:** Both political and supernatural — the longer you’re exposed to the Veil, the more it changes you.

### Opportunities
- **Cybernetic Enhancement:** Whether bought, stolen, or black-market installed, augments can give you an edge.  
- **Eldritch Power:** Those who dare can channel the Veil’s energies — for a price.  
- **The Shadows:** Information brokering, artifact smuggling, or sabotage jobs pay well if you can keep your head down and your trail cold.

**In Echo City,** you’re either climbing, running, or falling. The only question is: which way are you headed when the Veil reaches out?
