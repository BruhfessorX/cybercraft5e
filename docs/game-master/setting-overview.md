# Setting Overview

Cybercraft is set in **Echo City**, a sprawling megacity built atop ancient ruins where the Veil between worlds runs thin.

## Key Facts
- The city is divided into **Corporate Towers**, **Street Sectors**, and **Veil Zones**.
- The Veil is a metaphysical boundary that leaks eldritch energy into reality.
- Mega-factions control resources, information, and entire districts.

## Tone
Think **Blade Runner** meets **Hellraiser** with a dash of **Shadowrun**.
