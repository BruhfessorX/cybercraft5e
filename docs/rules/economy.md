# Economy & Currency

Cybercraft uses three main currencies:
- **Creds**: Standard electronic currency.
- **Chits**: Physical tokens for street-level trade.
- **Artefacts**: Eldritch relics used in high-value black-market exchanges.

# Economy & Equipment Tiers

In Cybercraft 5e, the flow of credits and the availability of gear are divided into **five tiers**, representing the technological and economic scale of Echolight City.  
Tiers also influence the rarity of items, the kinds of vendors that carry them, and the social or factional connections required to obtain them.

## Rarity Tags

Items may also have rarity tags in addition to their Tier.  
These help GMs determine **loot drops, vendor availability, and legality**.

| Rarity | Availability | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Common** | Found in most markets | No special restrictions. |
| **Uncommon** | Available in larger districts | May require faction connections. |
| **Rare** | Only in black markets or high-tier vendors | Often illegal without permits. |
| **Very Rare** | Unique vendors or quest rewards | Requires special circumstances. |
| **Legendary** | One-of-a-kind | Cannot be bought; quest or story rewards only. |

## Faction Discounts

Joining a faction grants **10–25% discounts** on items tied to that faction’s specialties.

| Faction | Discount | Specialties |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Corporate Security Forces** | 15% | Firearms, armor, surveillance gear |
| **Vampyrus Nation** | 20% | Stealth equipment, shadowcraft gear |
| **Umbralith Enclave** | 20% | Void-infused weapons, eldritch items |
| **Anomalie Collectives** | 25% | Reality-warping gear, anomaly tech |
| **Syndicate Cartels** | 15% | Black market items, smuggling gear |

## Black Market & Illegal Goods

Many items in Echolight City are **illegal** without permits or faction connections.  
These include high-tier weapons, prototype cyberware, and certain anomaly-based items.

- **Illegal Premium**: If purchasing without the right faction connections, increase the price by **50%–100%**.  
- **Risk Factor**: Illegal purchases risk attracting attention from law enforcement or rival gangs.  
- **Fence Prices**: Selling stolen or illegal goods usually nets **25–40%** of their listed value.

---

## Example Transactions

- **Tier 1 Street Pistol** – 75 credits, common, legal.  
- **Tier 2 Ballistic Vest** – 1,200 credits, uncommon, legal.  
- **Tier 3 Plasma Rifle** – 6,500 credits, rare, illegal without permit.  
- **Tier 4 Prototype Cloaking Field** – 22,000 credits, very rare, black market only.  
- **Tier 5 Reality Shard Blade** – Priceless, legendary, quest reward.

## GM Notes

- Tier pricing is a **baseline** — adjust based on district, supply chain disruptions, and faction influence.  
- Rarity tags are meant to **layer with tier** for more nuanced availability.  
- Black market purchases can be used as **plot hooks** for faction missions or law enforcement encounters.
