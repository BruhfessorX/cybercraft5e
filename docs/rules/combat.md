# Combat

Combat in **Cybercraft 5e** follows standard 5e rules, but with additional mechanics for firearms, cybernetics, and the effects of urban and Void-infused battlefields.

---

## Firearms
- **Light Firearms** — 1d6 damage, light property, typically one-handed (pistols, machine pistols).  
- **Heavy Firearms** — 2d6 damage, two-handed property, higher stopping power (rifles, shotguns).  
- **Reload** — Weapons with the reload property require an action or bonus action to reload, depending on design.  
- **Burst Fire** *(optional)* — Some weapons can target multiple creatures in a 10 ft square, using a single attack roll.

## Melee vs. Firearms

While firearms offer range and stopping power, close-quarters combat (CQC) remains deadly and viable through the following mechanics:

### Melee Advantages
- **Close-Quarters Threat** — A creature wielding a firearm has disadvantage on ranged attacks made within 5 ft of a hostile creature unless the firearm is designed for CQC (e.g., machine pistols, sawed-off shotguns).
- **Opportunity Strikes** — Moving out of melee range while holding a drawn firearm provokes opportunity attacks as normal, but the attacker gains +2 damage on a hit.
- **Weapon Grapple** — A creature within 5 ft can attempt a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) to knock a firearm aside or out of their hands.

### Firearm Counters
- **Point-Blank Burst** — Firearms with the CQC property ignore the disadvantage from being in melee.
- **Bayonets & Shock Blades** — Some firearms are fitted with melee attachments, allowing them to make melee attacks without switching weapons.

### Cybernetic & Gear Support
- **Reflex Boosters** — Grant advantage on reactions, allowing melee fighters to intercept more enemies before they can create distance.
- **Mag-Grip Gauntlets** — Allow you to grab and hold enemy weapons with advantage during grapples.

## Cover & Environments
- **Cover** —  
  - Half Cover: +2 AC and Dexterity saves.  
  - Three-Quarters Cover: +5 AC and Dexterity saves.  
  - Full Cover: Cannot be targeted directly.  
- **Urban Hazards** — Neon haze, flickering signs, or flying debris may impose disadvantage on Perception or ranged attacks.  
- **Dynamic Lighting** — Sudden darkness, flashing strobes, or power outages may trigger Sanity checks if combined with eldritch effects.

---

## Cybernetics in Combat
- **Overclock** — Push a cybernetic beyond safe limits as a bonus action to gain advantage on one attack, check, or save; take 1d6 damage afterward.  
- **System Damage** — When taking a critical hit, roll a d6; on a 5–6, one installed cybernetic temporarily shuts down until repaired.

---

## Tech & Magic Interference
When a cybernetic device, drone, or magical item is disrupted by EMP, Void energy, or hacking:
- Make a **Constitution saving throw** (DC set by effect) to keep it active.  
- On a failure, it is disabled for 1d4 rounds or until repaired/reactivated.

---

## Optional Rules
- **Suppressive Fire** — Spend extra ammo to force enemies in an area to make a Wisdom save or be forced into cover.  
- **Ricochet** — At DM’s discretion, bullets may ricochet in tight spaces, creating unpredictable hazards.  
- **Void Distortion** — Certain zones cause attacks to warp; ranged weapon ranges may be halved, and spells may require a concentration check on casting.
