# Combat

Combat in Cybercraft follows 5e rules with added layers for ranged firearms, cybernetic abilities, and hybrid weapons.

## Firearms
- **Light Firearms**: 1d6 damage, light property.
- **Heavy Firearms**: 2d6 damage, two-handed property.
- **Reload**: Some weapons require the reload property to be managed.

## Cover & Environments
- Urban combat often uses half, three-quarters, and full cover.
- Dim lighting and neon haze can impose disadvantage on Perception.

## Tech & Magic Interference
If a cybernetic device or magical item is disrupted, the user may need to pass a Constitution saving throw (DC varies) to keep it functional.
