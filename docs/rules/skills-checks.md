# Skill Checks

In Cybercraft 5e, most actions are resolved with an **ability check**. Roll a d20, add the relevant ability modifier, and apply any proficiency bonus if trained in the skill. If the total equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class (DC), the check succeeds.

## Group Checks
Sometimes multiple characters work together toward the same goal (e.g., synchronized hacking, group stealth). The group succeeds if **at least half** the members succeed.

---

## Opposed Checks
When two characters directly compete, both roll relevant ability checks. The higher result wins. Example: a hacker vs. an ICE program (Deception or Sleight of Hand vs. Investigation).

---

## Passive Scores
- **Passive Perception**: 10 + Perception bonus.
- **Passive Insight**: 10 + Insight bonus.
- **Passive Investigation**: 10 + Investigation bonus.
Used for background awareness, automatic detection, or ongoing analysis.

## Optional Rule: Degrees of Success
- **Beat DC by 5 or more**: Gain extra benefits (faster hack, extra loot, cleaner escape).
- **Fail by 5 or less**: Success at a cost (trigger alarm, partial information, minor damage).

## Optional Rule: Cinematic Stunts
Players may describe stylish or thematic actions for a potential bonus. The GM may grant advantage or a +2 bonus for particularly creative, setting-appropriate descriptions.
