# Sanity & Corruption

The **Veil** is a thin boundary between reality and eldritch chaos. Exposure can warp the mind and soul.

## Sanity Checks
When encountering an eldritch anomaly or horrifying event, make a Sanity saving throw (Wisdom or Charisma).

## Corruption
- Gain corruption points when using certain Void-based abilities or artifacts.
- At 5, 10, and 15 corruption points, gain a mutation or psychological scar.
- At 20 corruption points, the character is lost to the Void.
