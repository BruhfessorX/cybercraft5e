# Sanity & Corruption

The **Veil** is a fragile boundary between reality and the eldritch chaos beyond. Exposure to anomalies, Void energy, and incomprehensible horrors can fracture the mind and twist the soul. This system measures a character’s descent into madness and corruption.

---

## Sanity Checks

When a character witnesses an eldritch anomaly, horrific act, or experiences something that threatens their perception of reality, they must make a **Sanity saving throw**.

**Sanity Save:**  
- Roll a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw (player’s choice).  
- DC is determined by the severity of the event (typically **DC 10–25**).  
- Failure results in **Sanity damage** (temporary or permanent effects).

**Common Triggers:**  
- Witnessing a reality-warping anomaly.  
- Prolonged interaction with corrupted creatures.  
- Experiencing sudden reality shifts or impossible geometry.  
- Hearing voices or messages from beyond the Veil.

## Sanity Damage

Sanity damage is tracked separately from hit points.

| Damage | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **1–2** | Shaken: Disadvantage on the next Wisdom/Charisma check. |
| **3–4** | Rattled: Disadvantage on all Perception and Insight checks for 1 hour. |
| **5–6** | Fractured: Short-term madness (roll on Madness Table). |
| **7+** | Broken: Long-term madness or psychosis; GM discretion. |

**Recovering Sanity:**  
- A **long rest** in a safe environment can restore 1–2 points.  
- Certain gear, cybernetic mods, or faction therapy programs can speed recovery.  
- Some madness effects may require magical/psionic treatment.

## Corruption

Corruption represents the creeping influence of the Void and eldritch forces on the body and soul. Unlike Sanity, corruption does not heal naturally.

**Gaining Corruption Points:**  
- Using certain Void-based powers, relics, or cyberware.  
- Failing Sanity checks by **5 or more**.  
- Exposure to high-tier anomalies.  
- Making pacts with Void entities.  

**Thresholds:**  
- **5 Points:** Minor Mutation – Subtle physical or mental changes.  
- **10 Points:** Major Mutation – Noticeable supernatural trait; +1 ability in exchange for a penalty elsewhere.  
- **15 Points:** Eldritch Transformation – Character’s body and mind are permanently altered; often feared by society.  
- **20 Points:** Lost to the Void – The character is no longer playable, becoming an NPC under GM control.

---

## Mutation Examples

**Minor:**  
- Eyes glow faintly in darkness.  
- Unnatural reflexes (+1 initiative, disadvantage on Deception against humans).  
- Whispering voices only you can hear.

**Major:**  
- Shadowy tendrils sprout from your back (usable as an unarmed attack).  
- Skin takes on an alien texture, granting +1 AC but disadvantage on Persuasion checks.  
- You can smell fear (advantage on Insight checks vs. frightened creatures).

**Eldritch Transformation:**  
- Immune to fear, but cannot regain Sanity.  
- Can see partially into the Void (advantage on Perception vs. anomalies, disadvantage vs. illusions).  
- Gains a powerful Void-based attack, but each use adds corruption.

## GM Notes

- **Sanity** is temporary and recoverable — use it for short-term tension.  
- **Corruption** is permanent and cumulative — use it for long-term stakes.  
- Factions may react differently to corrupted characters; some may recruit them, others may try to eliminate them.  
- PCs who fully “fall to the Void” can become unique villains or eldritch bosses in future campaigns.
