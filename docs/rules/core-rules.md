# Core Rules

Cybercraft 5e is fully compatible with the 5e System Reference Document (SRD 5.1), with additional rules for technology, eldritch effects, and the fusion of both.

## Rule Additions
- **Cybernetic Augments**: Special implants and modifications that grant unique abilities.
- **Corruption & Sanity**: Tracking the toll of exposure to the Veil and eldritch horrors.
- **Faction Influence**: Your standing with powerful groups can unlock gear, allies, and missions.
- **Tech-Eldritch Interaction**: Rules for how magic and cybernetics can disrupt or enhance each other.
