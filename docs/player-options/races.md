# Races
*The peoples of Letheris, from the familiar to the otherworldly.*

---

In **Cybercraft 5e**, your choice of race reflects not just your physical form, but your cultural heritage, social connections, and sometimes the supernatural forces that shaped you.  
Whether you are a street-born Human, an immortal predator among the Vampyrus, a shadow-born Umbralith, a mind-bending Anomalie, or a machine-souled Synthetic, your race shapes your place in Echolight City.

## Choosing a Race
When selecting your race, consider:
- **Origin:** Where were you born or created?  
- **Faction Ties:** Does your race give you allies or enemies?  
- **Appearance:** What features set you apart from others?  
- **Abilities:** How will your racial traits shape your playstyle?

## Role in the World
Races in Letheris are more than stat bonuses — they are political identities.  
In Echolight City:
- Humans dominate population numbers but not necessarily power.  
- Vampyrus control the underworld and hidden courts.  
- Umbraliths keep to the shadowed edges, feared for their connection to the Void.  
- Anomalie are unpredictable, often viewed with suspicion or awe.  
- Synthetics serve as both tools of the megacorps and free-thinking individuals.
