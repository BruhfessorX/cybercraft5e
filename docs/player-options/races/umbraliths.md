# Umbraliths
*Born of the Void, wrapped in shadow and starlight.*

---

## Overview
Umbraliths hail from the depths of the Void — a shadowy, eldritch realm that touches the mortal plane in hidden places. Their bodies shimmer with a fusion of darkness and cosmic energy, and their very presence carries the chill of infinite space. They are deeply attuned to the primordial forces of the Void, drawing strength from its alien essence.

Many see them as omens or harbingers, their motives and loyalties as inscrutable as the stars themselves.
