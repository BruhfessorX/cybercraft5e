# Synthetics
*Metal, mind, and machine — engineered perfection or corporate property.*

---

## Overview
Synthetics are advanced humanoid machines with artificial intelligence, designed to blend seamlessly with the city's technological infrastructure. Created by mega-corporations, they are stronger, faster, and more durable than most organics. Their forms range from sleek and humanoid to abstract and alien, depending on their intended function and the whims of their creators.

While some remain loyal to their programming, others break free, forging their own identities in a world where they may be seen as tools, weapons, or threats.
