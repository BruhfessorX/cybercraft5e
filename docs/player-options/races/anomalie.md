# Anomalie
*The impossible made flesh.*

---

## Overview
Anomalies are beings that exist beyond the boundaries of conventional reality, embodying phenomena that defy natural laws and mortal understanding. They can manifest as living creatures, strange phenomena, or even abstract forces given form. Each Anomalie’s nature is unique, and their very existence challenges the stability of the world around them.

Some are revered as divine messengers, others feared as harbingers of disaster — but all are bound by one truth: reality bends in their presence.

## Anomalie Traits
Your Anomalie character has the following racial traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase one ability score by **2** and another by **1**, or increase three different scores by **1** each.

**Age.** Anomalies do not age in a traditional sense. Some are timeless, while others are transient phenomena that fade after decades or centuries.

**Size.** Anomalies range widely in form, but for game purposes, your size is **Medium**.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is **30 feet**.

### **Beyond Natural Law**
- You count as both a humanoid and an aberration.
- You have advantage on saving throws against effects that would alter your form against your will (such as *polymorph*).

---

### **Anomalous Nature**
Choose one minor magical effect (from the *thaumaturgy*, *druidcraft*, or *prestidigitation* cantrips) to represent your ever-present reality distortion. You can use this at will.

---

### **Alien Resilience**
You have resistance to psychic damage.

---

### **Languages**
You can speak, read, and write Common and one additional language of your choice. Your voice may carry strange echoes, harmonics, or distortions.

---

### **Cognita (C)**
*Minds are your canvas.*

---
