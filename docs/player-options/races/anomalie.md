# Anomalie
*The impossible made flesh.*

---

## Overview
Anomalies are beings that exist beyond the boundaries of conventional reality, embodying phenomena that defy natural laws and mortal understanding. They can manifest as living creatures, strange phenomena, or even abstract forces given form. Each Anomalie’s nature is unique, and their very existence challenges the stability of the world around them.

Some are revered as divine messengers, others feared as harbingers of disaster — but all are bound by one truth: reality bends in their presence.
