# Vampyrus
*Predators in the shadows of Echo City.*

## Overview
Vampyrus are secretive, immortal beings whose thirst for blood fuels their supernatural powers. Masters of shadow and darkness, they walk the fine line between humanity and monstrosity. Their heightened senses, unnatural speed, and preternatural charm make them both alluring and deadly.

Vampyrus society is divided into powerful bloodlines, each with unique gifts and weaknesses, and their politics often spill into the mortal world in whispers and bloodshed.
