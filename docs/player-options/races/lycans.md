# Lycan

The **Lycan** are remnants of humanity twisted by the Veil’s corruption — feral beings whose blood resonates with predatory instincts and void-tainted power. Once human, their evolution began when the first Veil breaches tore through genetic boundaries, fusing instinct with the supernatural. They are not beholden to the moon, but to the pulse of the city and the rhythm of the Veil itself — the *Hunger Code* that drives them.

Their existence is one of control and release: to master the beast is to walk between two worlds — man and monster, logic and instinct.

### **Bloodhowler**
Some Lycans channel the Veil through sound and fury — their howls can rupture minds and unnerve enemies across entire blocks. Bloodhowlers are chaos incarnate, spreading terror before the kill.

- **Veil Howl:** As an action, unleash a psychic howl in a 20 ft. radius. Enemies make a Wisdom save (DC 8 + proficiency + Con mod) or become frightened until the end of your next turn.  
- **Amplified Rage:** When you enter your Hybrid Form, your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d4 psychic damage.  
- **Eldritch Feedback:** Once per long rest, when you reduce a creature to 0 HP, you regain a number of hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your level.  

---

### **Alpha Strain**
Leaders among Lycans, the Alpha Strain channel their dominance into a commanding presence. Their voice alone can rally allies and suppress rivals.

- **Predator’s Command:** Allies within 10 ft. gain advantage on saving throws against fear.  
- **Pack Instinct:** When an ally within 5 ft. hits a target, you may use your reaction to make a melee attack against the same creature.  
- **Dominance Pulse:** Once per short rest, emit a pheromonal burst forcing creatures of your choice within 15 ft. to make a Charisma save or become frightened until your next turn.  

---

### **Ironhide**
Born of Veil exposure and raw survival, Ironhides are walking fortresses of scarred flesh and sinew — monstrous endurance given form.

- **Veil-Hardened Flesh:** You gain resistance to nonmagical slashing, bludgeoning, and piercing damage while in Hybrid Form.  
- **Adaptive Regeneration:** When reduced below half HP, regain 1d4 + Constitution modifier HP at the start of each turn for 3 rounds (once per long rest).  
- **Unyielding Fury:** When you take damage from a critical hit, roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, reduce the critical to normal damage instead.  

---

### **Veilstalker**
The Veil took more than blood from these Lycans — it took their reflection. Lost Veilstalkers move between shadow and data, haunting both physical and digital realms.

- **Veil Step:** As a bonus action, teleport up to 15 ft. to an unoccupied space you can see that’s in dim light or darkness.  
- **Umbral Awareness:** You can see through magical or technological darkness within 30 ft.  
- **Predator in the Code:** You gain advantage on Stealth and Technology checks made while in dim light or interfacing with cybernetic systems.  

---

### **Eclipse Eater**
The rarest and most feared of their kind, Eclipse Eaters devour the essence of their foes — not for hunger, but for power. They become what they consume, if only for a while.

- **Essence Feast:** When you reduce a creature to 0 HP, you can consume part of its flesh or data-essence as a bonus action. You gain one of the following temporary benefits for 1 minute (your choice):  
  - +2 to Strength  
  - Resistance to one damage type the creature had  
  - Temporary hit points equal to half your level + Con mod  
- **Devour the Dead:** You may consume the corpse of a recently slain creature to regain one expended use of your Hybrid Form (once per long rest).  
- **Predatory Memory:** Once per day, you can recall one ability or skill proficiency from a creature you’ve consumed in the past 24 hours, gaining that proficiency for 1 hour.

**"We were the hunters before the corporations. Before the Veil. Now the city itself trembles beneath our scent. The pack survives, even when the world forgets our names."**  
— *Eclipse Eater proverb*

### **Chromeclaw**
The **Chromeclaws** are the next step in the Lycan evolution — beasts that embraced augmentation rather than rejecting it. Their flesh is threaded with conductive alloys and neural lattices that channel Veil energy like electricity. To them, metal is not a cage — it’s another kind of muscle.

- **Cybernetic Integration:** You count as both biological and cybernetic for the purposes of abilities, items, and effects. You gain advantage on saving throws against technological poisons and diseases.  
- **Overdrive Surge:** Once per short rest, you may overcharge your cybernetic implants while in Hybrid Form. For 1 minute, your unarmed attacks deal an additional 1d6 lightning damage, and your movement speed increases by 10 ft.   
- **Metal and Bone:** Your claws are partially cybernetic — they count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks.

**“The pack called me impure. Said I traded blood for wire. Maybe they’re right — but when the hunt begins, who tears through steel faster?”**  
— *Vex, Chromeclaw alpha*
