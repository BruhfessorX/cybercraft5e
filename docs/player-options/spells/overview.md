# Spellcasting in Cybercraft 5e

In **Cybercraft 5e**, spellcasting represents a mix of **technological mastery**, **void manipulation**, and **urban survival tactics**. These powers may be accessed through implants, neural training, ancient grimoires, or anomalous artifacts.

---

## Spellcasting Basics
Cybercraft 5e uses the same **spell slots** and **casting levels** as standard 5e, with the following key differences:

- **Flavor & Source:** Spells are categorized into **Technomancy**, **Voidcraft**, and **Urban Utility**.
- **Tech vs Magic:** Some spells require functioning technology (e.g., Technomancy), while others draw purely on anomalous energy (Voidcraft).
- **Urban Influence:** Many spells interact with environmental factors like neon signage, dense crowds, surveillance systems, and megastructure layouts.
- **Corruption Risk:** Certain Voidcraft spells may cause **Corruption Points** on use (see *Sanity & Corruption* rules).

## Spell Categories

### **Technomancy**
The fusion of magic and code — hacking reality through digital intrusion, drone control, and hardlight constructs.  
- Often requires a **neural interface** or similar focus.
- Ineffective in **anti-tech fields** unless specifically void-enhanced.

### **Voidcraft**
Eldritch power from the infinite darkness between realities. Twists space, mind, and matter in dangerous ways.  
- May risk **Corruption** on failed casting checks for high-level spells.
- Unaffected by anti-tech zones but vulnerable to *null wards*.

### **Urban Utility**
A practical blend of magic and streetwise ingenuity, optimized for megacity survival.  
- Leverages the built environment — architecture, infrastructure, and urban chaos.
- Some effects are stronger in **dense population zones** or near advanced infrastructure.

## Spell Components in a Cyberpunk World

In Cybercraft 5e:  
- **Verbal (V):** Spoken code sequences, voice commands, chants, or signal tones.  
- **Somatic (S):** Gestures, AR interface swipes, device manipulations.  
- **Material (M):** May be replaced by devices, focus rigs, or cybernetic modules.  

Casters can use a **cybernetic casting focus** instead of a traditional arcane focus or component pouch.

## New Casting Traits

- **Overclocking:** Some Technomancy spells can be *overclocked*, increasing damage or range at the cost of temporary system strain (1 level of exhaustion or HP loss).
- **Void Feedback:** Certain Voidcraft spells have a chance to cause psychic backlash, requiring a Constitution or Wisdom save or taking psychic damage.
- **Urban Synergy:** Some Urban Utility spells grant extra benefits when used in **urban combat encounters** (GM discretion).

---

## Learning & Preparing Spells

Classes that cast spells gain access to them according to their **Spell List** in their class description. Cybercraft 5e does not use a unified “all caster” list — each subclass may have exclusive access to certain spells.

---

## Casting in Hostile Environments

- **Anti-Tech Zones:** Nullify most Technomancy unless the caster has a void-adapted casting focus.
- **Void Storms:** Cause random surges or failures in Voidcraft.
- **High-Density Networks:** May enhance Technomancy range and Urban Utility effects.

---

## Optional Rule: Casting Mishaps

When a spell fails due to an interrupted connection, corrupted code, or void instability, roll on the appropriate **Mishap Table**.  
The GM may also call for a Mishap roll on a **natural 1** for a spell attack or a failed concentration check by 5 or more.
